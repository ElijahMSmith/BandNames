Get event to register in background.js

- Click on user settings, edit name, input new name to the blank, type password
- Username and password have to be known, possibly put in another JSON file
- Exit back to discord at the end
In this case, remove urlListen.js

Alternative: 
- Set urlListen to bring to foreground (.focus() does nothing currently)
- Set window to fixed size.
    - If popup opened by window.open(), keep size constant and align everything to the left
    - If popup opened in browser by showAction, keep current realignments
