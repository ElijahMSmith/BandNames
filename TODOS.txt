TODOS:
- Slot to add custom names
    - Save to a new file - need to be consistent when updating to a new version, so it shouldn't get overwritten on a new version.
    - Can also ask it to download a copy/export or load from a text file
- Minimum name length



- New popup for adding new names (button on main popup that closes current and opens the new one
    - Allows you to randomly generate adjective and nouns, add to local storage option
    - Can also input names directly to add into local storage
    - Need to be able to import and export
    - Also must keep the generated file of custom names (which loads with the rest of the band names into one big array to pick from)
        - When extension updates/reloads, that file shouldn't be replaced.



Generation planning:
- Each list gets loaded when the popup or popout is created, nouns and adjectives, to their own arrays
    - Sort by length of the word
- HTML should have a place for the name generated
- Should be able to generated entirely new names, or the noun/adjective individually
- Also needs a maximum length field

- When generating both: Pick a noun at random, then adjective
    - Noun should be no longer than (maxCharCount - minAdjectiveLength)
    - Adjective should be chosen randomly from those no longer than (maxCharCount - chosenNounLength)
- If regenerating either part or both, the next option should not contain either the same noun or adjective unless there is no other option for one or the either.
