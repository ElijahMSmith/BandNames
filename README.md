### Manual, as an Unpacked Extension

You can get a copy of all the files in this extension by cloning this repository to the desired location with `git clone https://github.com/ElijahMSmith/BandNames`

After cloning the files, go to the chrome extensions manager page by either putting "chrome://extensions" in the url bar or click the three dots in the upper right corner of the window, hover over more tools, then click extensions.

Turn "Developer Mode" on with the switch in the upper right hand corner.

Next, select "Load unpacked" (which just means the files haven't been compacted down to a single chrome executable yet) from the upper left corner of the screen, navigate to and select the folder containing all the cloned files, then click open.

The extension will now be loaded onto your chrome browser. It is designed to sync with any other browsers that sync to your Google account, so you shouldn't have to do anything if you go to a different device.

### Roadmap

- Allow users to add their own names.
- Export your custom names to a text file.
