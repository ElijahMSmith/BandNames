TODOS:
- Slot to add custom names
    - Save to a new file - need to be consistent when updating to a new version, so it shouldn't get overwritten on a new version.
    - Can also ask it to download a copy/export or load from a text file



- New popup for adding new names (button on main popup that closes current and opens the new one
    - Allows you to randomly generate adjective and nouns, add to local storage option
    - Can also input names directly to add into local storage
    - Need to be able to import and export
    - Also must keep the generated file of custom names (which loads with the rest of the band names into one big array to pick from)
        - When extension updates/reloads, that file shouldn't be replaced.
