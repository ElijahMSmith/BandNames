TODOS:
Figure out why randomGen is still running out of bounds for maxPossible and possibleWords

min/max are being updated correctly between layout changes but not for random gen when a new name is 
created since that doesn't actually work right. Fix that and the min/max issues will resolve themselves

- Store default mode to open to, whatever was open last
- newWordFromList doesn't work properly for generating random names since it will make sure both 
  the noun and adjective independently are between min and max, not collectively
- Custom names
