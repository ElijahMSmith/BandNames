TODOS:
- Slot to add custom names
    - Save to a new file - need to be consistent when updating to a new version, so it shouldn't get overwritten on a new version.
    - Can also ask it to download a copy/export or load from a text file
- Minimum name length



- New popup for adding new names (button on main popup that closes current and opens the new one
    - Allows you to randomly generate adjective and nouns, add to local storage option
    - Can also input names directly to add into local storage
    - Need to be able to import and export
    - Also must keep the generated file of custom names (which loads with the rest of the band names into one big array to pick from)
        - When extension updates/reloads, that file shouldn't be replaced.

Once random generation is working, it would be cool to have a stored state in the chrome storage that tells us which mode to open to initially
Defaults to whatever the last used mode was when either the popup or window was open
