Option to set maximum characters allowed when generating a name, all future names picked must be of that length or smaller

Problem: We're loading and unloading so often, it MIGHT be rather inefficient to resort every time.

If we're just updating arrays, we can just addto a specific part of the datastructure in question
- Should make a 2D array of the length of the maximum word. When loading words, add each one to the array at the index of its length
- When asked to choose, default is no limit. If there is a limit, use max as the sum of the size of the groups with equal or fewer letters as limit
- Generate random number, move down outer array until index appears in that group (subtract from this index each group size that can fit in the index)
- Pick item from that group and display

Need to also account for limits <= 0, or limits short enough that we don't have a name to fit

Current work:
- Set blank default to be the length of the longest retrieved word
- When we call to get a name, check the input. If it's valid, make that the new variable value and query a random name or equal or lesser length
    - If it's not valid, replace with the largest value and query any name

- On load, sort into 2D array based on character length (without spaces, but put value WITH spaces into correct slot)
    - Need to keep running length of a row. At the end, should create an array that keeps all previous slot and current slot name counts, cumulative
- Implement math for picking
