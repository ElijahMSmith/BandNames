TODOS:
Figure out why randomGen is still running out of bounds for maxPossible and possibleWords

min/max are being updated correctly between layout changes but not for random gen when a new name is 
created since that doesn't actually work right. Fix that and the min/max issues will resolve themselves

- Store default mode to open to, whatever was open last
- newWordFromList doesn't work properly for generating random names since it will make sure both 
  the noun and adjective independently are between min and max, not collectively
- Custom names



TODO: 
When regenerating both, set both currents to -1 index so that there isn't a cap on what the first word can become
In that case, should compare currentWord instead of currentIndex for checking if we get the same thing twice in a row


Something I think will be a problem at some point: If someone picks a lower min length and we regenerate only one word or both and there aren't anything of few enough characters, what gets displayed?
- Should set something where the console logs.
