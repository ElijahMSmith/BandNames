TODOS:
- JS setup that runs once when the scripts are first loaded to set the mode to whatever the default is, 
  then perform the html updates and generation
  - Take the generation out of the loading functions so we aren't generating and overwriting values before they are seen.



min/max are being updated correctly between layout changes but not for random gen when a new name is 
created since that doesn't actually work right. Fix that and the min/max issues will resolve themselves

- Store default mode to open to, whatever was open last
- newWordFromList doesn't work properly for generating random names since it will make sure both 
  the noun and adjective independently are between min and max, not collectively
- Custom names
