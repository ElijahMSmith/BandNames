Option to set maximum characters allowed when generating a name, all future names picked must be of that length or smaller

Problem: We're loading and unloading so often, it MIGHT be rather inefficient to resort every time.

If we're just updating arrays, we can just addto a specific part of the datastructure in question
- Should make a 2D array of the length of the maximum word. When loading words, add each one to the array at the index of its length
- When asked to choose, default is no limit. If there is a limit, use max as the sum of the size of the groups with equal or fewer letters as limit
- Generate random number, move down outer array until index appears in that group (subtract from this index each group size that can fit in the index)
- Pick item from that group and display

Need to also account for limits <= 0, or limits short enough that we don't have a name to fit
